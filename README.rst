`pyfftlog' for 3D cosmological power spectra
============================================
This is an updated version of `pyfftlog' which add convenience functions for 
the calculation of 3D correlation functions from 3D power spectra in a 
cosmological context (and vice versa) in python only.

The modifications in this fork relative to the original `pyfftlog' were made 
following heavily from Anze Slosar's (@slosar) similar implementation in C and C++.
This is essentially a python implementation of that work.

These modifications have not been extensively tested; use as your own risk.

`pyfftlog` - python version of FFTLog
=====================================

This is a python version of the logarithmic FFT code *FFTLog* as presented in
Appendix B of [Hamilton_2000]_ and published at `casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog
<http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog>`_.

A simple `f2py`-wrapper (`fftlog`) can be found on `github.com/prisae/fftlog
<https://github.com/prisae/fftlog>`_.  Tests have shown that `fftlog` is a bit
faster than `pyfftlog`, but `pyfftlog` is easier to implement, as you only need
`NumPy` and `SciPy`, without the need to compile anything.

I hope that `FFTLog` will make it into `SciPy` in the future, which will make
this project redundant.

Be aware that `pyfftlog` has not been tested extensively. It works fine
for the attached test, which is the test from the original code, and my use
case, which is `pyfftlog.fftl` with `mu=0.5` (sine-transform), `q=0`
(unbiased), `k=1`, `kropt=1`, and `tdir=` (forward). Please let me know if you
encounter any issues.


Description of FFTLog from the FFTLog-Website
---------------------------------------------

FFTLog is a set of fortran subroutines that compute the fast Fourier or Hankel
(= Fourier-Bessel) transform of a periodic sequence of logarithmically spaced
points.

FFTLog can be regarded as a natural analogue to the standard Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT), in the sense that, just as the normal FFT gives the exact (to
machine precision) Fourier transform of a linearly spaced periodic sequence, so
also FFTLog gives the exact Fourier or Hankel transform, of arbitrary order m,
of a logarithmically spaced periodic sequence.

FFTLog shares with the normal FFT the problems of ringing (response to sudden
steps) and aliasing (periodic folding of frequencies), but under appropriate
circumstances FFTLog may approximate the results of a continuous Fourier or
Hankel transform.

The FFTLog algorithm was originally proposed by [Talman_1978]_.
